Blogs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/finite-automata/":{"body":"In this article, We'll talk about one of the fundamental concepts in computer science - The Finite Automata. We'll look what exactly it is and understand where can they be used. \nWhat is a Finite Automata?\nA one word answer would be - a recognizer.\nIt simply tells whether a string belongs to a language or not.\nIt is something like asking it, whether the string - अभिलेख belongs to the English Language and it simply replies No.\nI'll use the transition diagram to demonstrate how it exactly works.\nTransition Diagram Basics\n\nEvery Transition diagram has a starting state and is represented by:\n\n\n\nEvery Transition diagram has a final state and is represented by:\n\n\n\nTo indicate that the automata will transition to state B from A when a symbol a is encountered we use:\n\n\n\nTo indicate that the automata will not transition to another state when a symbol a is encountered we use:\n\n\nNote: We refer the arrow head in transition diagram as an edge and that 'a' above the edge as a label.\nTypes of Finite Automata\nFinite Automata are of two types:\n1. Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)\nLets see a transition diagram first. Let me just remind you this is not a complete diagram, it is missing a start and end state.\n\nThings to note here:\na. The state B has two edges with the same label a to two different states - C and B itself. This is what non-deterministic means, you cannot tell where the automata will transition to.\nb. The state B doesn't care about the symbol b i.e., it has no edge with the label b.\nc. The state C also doesn't care about the symbol a, i.e., it has no edge with label a.\nd. NFA allows epsilon transition, i.e. you can set transition from one state to another state on empty string as well.\n2. Deterministic Finite Automate (DFA)\nLets see a transition diagram first.\n\nComparing the above image with the previous image we get the following differences:\na. State B has two edges with different labels. We cannot have multiple edges with same labels from a state in DFA.\nb. Both state B and C now care about the symbols b and a respectively. In DFA there must a edge for every symbols in the language from every state.\nc. DFA don't allow epsilon transition.\nYou might have felt, NFA more powerful, but let me tell you that they have the same power and both of them are capable of recognizing the same langauge- Regular Language. It can be proved that they are equivalent but not here, for sure.\nBefore we dive more into Finite Automata, lets look at some basic fundamental required:\n1.Alphabet\nAlphabet is a finite, non-empty set whose elements are symbols.\n2. String\nA string is a sequence of alphabet. It is denoted by w and |w| denotes its length.\n3. Concatenation\nIf x and y are two strings or symbols, then their concatenation xy means, string x followed by string y.\n4. OR\nOR is generally denoted by a + or |. Notation like x|y means either x or y.\n5. Kleen Closure\nKleen Closure, denoted by a *, means one or more occurrence. Notation like (x)* mean one or more occurrence of x.\nI think its time to get somewhat formal.\nFinite Automata Again\nFinite Automata is a model of computation that recognizes regular language. It has finite set of states, edges labelled with symbols that leads to states and a transition function which tells where to transit, on a particluar input symbol.\nBasically, we pass in, a string to a finite automate it transits through multiple states according to the transition function, if it reaches the end of the string and it is at the final (end) state, the automata is said to accept the string. \nIf it reaches the end of the string and it is not at the final state, the automata is said to reject the string (just like how she rejected me!!).\nI'll now present you a example of designing a Finite Automate - DFA.\nA Finite Automata for Language, that has two symbols - a and b where the number of b's is even.\nThought Process\na. We can start by thinking the strings that belongs to this langauge - a (Since 0 is even and it has even number of b so it must accepted by our automata.), abb, bb, aabb, abbbb etc and try working out with those strings.\nb. We should do something, such that we are able to count the number of b's, while we are reading through the string, we should be at the final state whenever the number of b is even.\nLets start by assuming that we'll need just two states - A and B. A being both the start state and B the final state.\n\nRemember what I said earlier, we have to be at the final state when the number of b is even. So we have to remain at the state A when we get a a because a single a is even b.\n\nNow we need to think of, what to do when we get a b at the state A - The start state. Since a single b should be rejected, we should move to the state B.\n\nWe'll be at state B after we read a b when we are at state A. So when we get another b it's the second b i.e., even number of b's and we have to be at the final state whenever we encounter even b's. So ,\n\nOk the final question, what to do when we are at state B and we encounter a a? - With the configuration so far we'll be at state B when we have odd number of bs. So no matter how many a's we encounter we need to stay at state B. So,\n\nThis is it, the final configuration for our DFA.\nNow, lets see how we can define the transition function for this DFA.\nA transition function takes two inputs - the current state and the input. It outputs the state where the automata should transit to.\nSo, when we are at the state A and encounter the symbol a we stay at the state a, so we write\nTF(A, a) = A\n\nSimilarly when we are at state A and encounter the symbol b we move to the state B, so \nTF(A, b) = B \n\nSimilarly we can write,\nTF(B, a) = B\nTF(B, b) = A\n\nUsage\n\nFlex - The Lexical analyzer generator, uses the concept of Finite Automata.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/finite-automata/","title":"Understanding The Finite Automata"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/stalking-the-cpp-compiler/":{"body":"In this article, we will look into the code generated by the C++ compiler and understand whats happening under the hood.\nSo here is the program which we will work on:\n\nint main() {\n  int x = 5;\n\n  x = x + 1;\n\n  int y = x;\n\n  y = x + 7;\n}\n\nThis program does nothing interesting but we can learn a lot if we start looking into the generated assembly.\nI'll use godbolt's Compiler Explorer to quickly get the generated assembly for x86_64.\nWhat I got from x86_64 gcc 14.1 with no optimization enabled is:\nmain:\n    push    rbp\n    mov     rbp, rsp\n    mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5\n    add     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 1\n    mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]\n    sub     eax, 1\n    mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax\n    mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]\n    add     eax, 7\n    mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax\n    mov     eax, 0\n    pop     rbp\n    ret\n\nx86_64 Linux Assembly Basics\nI'll quickly give a walk through of assembly instructions used here:\n\n\npush A: Pushes A into the stack.\n\n\nmov D, S:  Copy the content at S to D \n\n\nadd A, B: Add the content at A and B and stores the result into A.\n\n\nsub A, B: Get the difference from A to B and store the result in A.\n\n\npop B: Pop an element from the stack and store into B.\n\n\nret: Return from the function (We'll look into what exactly it means later.)\n\n\nIf we ignore all the nitty-gritty here and look at the fourth line of the generated assembly, i.e.,\nmov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5\n\nWe don't know what DWORD PTR [rbp-4] is, but with the knowledge we have gained so far. We are pretty sure\nthat it is copying the value 5 somewhere (we'll look exactly where later) lets say to [rbp-4] for now.\nIt is exactly what the following C++ code is expected to do:\nint x = 5; // Write the value 5 to some memory location and name it x.\n\nLets move on to the next assembly instruction:\nadd DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 1\n\nWe again ignore DWORD PTR [rbp-4] for now. But we are pretty sure it is adding the value 1 with the content\nat [rbp-4] (We exactly don't know what it is) and stores back the value at [rbp-4]. Previously we stored the value 5\nat [rbp-4] now we added 1 to it. So it must store the value 6 now. It is exactly what the following C++ code is\nexpected to do:\nx = x + 1; // add 1 to the value of x and store the result in x itself.\n\nNext assembly instruction we look at is:\nmov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]\n\nThis is again a move instruction. We still don't know what DWORD PTR [rbp-4] means and we also don't know what eax means\nbut we are pretty sure we are copying the value at [rbp-4] to eax. If it is, eax now holds the value 6. We haven't exactly\nwritten the equivalent C++ line for this generated assembly, this is what compiler felt the need to generate itself.\nThe next instruction is:\nsub eax, 1\n\nWe yet don't know what eax is but we are sure, we are subtracting the value at eax which is 6 by 1, so eax now holds 5.\nTo summarize previous assembly instructions:\n\n\n[rbp-4] holds the value our variable x is expected to hold, i.e., 6\n\n\nCopy the value at [rbp-4] to eax.\n\n\nSubtracted the value at eax by one.\n\n\nSo what we can conclude is we have the value x-1 at eax.\nLooks like our Compiler is preparing for the following C++ code.\nint y = x - 1;\n\nIt has already obtained the value for x-1 and stored at eax. It now just need to copy this value at eax to some location\nwhich it does using:\nmov DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax\n\nWe exactly don't know what DWORD PTR [rbp-8] does, but we are here copying the value at eax which holds x-1 to some location [rbp-8].\nThe upcoming instructions are similar to the previous ones:\nmov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]\nadd eax, 7\nmov DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax\n\nThis simply achieves what is expected from the following C++ code:\ny = x + 7;\n\nTo Summarize: \n\n\n[rbp-4] holds the value, x is expected to store.\n\n\nCopy the value at [rbp-4], i.e., value of x to eax.\n\n\nAdd 7 to the value at eax, eax now holds the value of x + 7.\n\n\nCopy the value at eax (x + 7) to some location [rbp-8].\n\n\nToo much of abstraction so far. Lets dive somewhat deeper now.\nStorage Organization\nEvery program run in its own address space, which can be divided in the following way.\n      ------------------------\n      |        Code          |\n      ------------------------\n      |        Static        |\n      ------------------------\n      |        Heap          |\n      ------------------------\n      |       Free Memory    |   \n      ------------------------\n      |       Stack          |   \n      ------------------------\n\nCode\nThe generated code is kept in this region. It's size is fixed.\nStatic\nThings like global constants are placed in the region called Static.\nHeap\nHeap is dynamic in nature. It is used to manage data that may outlive the call to procedure(function) that created it. Heaps grow downwards i.e, towards the higher memory address.\nStack\nStack is also dynamic in nature. It is used to store data structures called activation record(also known as stack frame or call frame) that are generated during function call. Stack grows upwards i.e., towards lower memory address. This concept is necessary when we start talking about rbp.\nWhenever a procedure is called, space for the variables are created in the stack, i.e., push operations are performed for the local variables. When the procedure terminates the space is popped off the stack. This should be enough to justify the statement that, stack is dynamic.\nCPU Registers\nRegisters are memory unit within the CPU. Since they are within the CPU (processor) they are very quick to access. The properties of the registers are processor dependent. Anyways we will look into very few registers used by the compiler in the previously generated code.\n\n\neax: 32 bit general purpose register.\n\n\nrsp: Stack Pointer Register. Points to the current top of the stack. It stores the address of the current top of stack.\n\n\nrbp: Base Pointer Register. Used as a reference pointer during function call.\n\n\nNow we have all the basics required to look into the entire generated assembly.\nRevisiting the generated assembly\nI'll start by assuming that the main function has already been called.\nWhen the first instruction is executed\npush rbp\n\nthe stack looks like the following:\n|                     |\n-----------------------\n|       rbp           | &lt;- rsp\n-----------------------\n|                     |\n-----------------------\n|                     |\n\nFig: The current stack status.\n\nThe next instruction:\nmov rbp, rsp\n\ncopies the value of rsp into rbp. What this means is, rbp now holds the address of the current top of stack.\nThe next instruction:\nmov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5\n\nputs the value 5 to a memory location that is 4 bytes below the address currently stored by rbp.\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|        5           |\n----------------------\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp\n----------------------\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status after first move.\n\nThe next instruction then add the value 1 to the content at [rbp-4].\nadd DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 1\n\nThe stack now looks like:\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|        6           |\n----------------------\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp\n----------------------\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status after the first add operation.\n\nThe next instruction copies the value at [rbp-4] into the eax register.\nmov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]\n\n|                    |\n----------------------       -----\n|        6           |       |eax|\n----------------------       -----\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp | 6 |\n----------------------       -----\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status and the value at eax register.\n\nThe next instruction:\nsub eax, 1\n\nsubtracts the value at eax by 1 and stores it back into eax.\n|                    |\n----------------------       -----\n|        6           |       |eax|\n----------------------       -----\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp | 5 |\n----------------------       -----\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status and the value at eax register.\n\nThe next instruction: \nmov DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax\n\ncopies the value at eax into the memory location 8 bytes below the address at rbp.\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|        5           |\n----------------------       -----\n|        6           |       |eax|\n----------------------       -----\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp | 5 |\n----------------------       -----\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status and the value at eax register.\n\nThe next instruction:\nmov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]\n\ncopies the value at the location 4 bytes below the address stored by the rbp register.\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|        5           |\n----------------------       -----\n|        6           |       |eax|\n----------------------       -----\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp | 6 |\n----------------------       -----\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status and the value at eax register.\n\nThe next instruction:\nadd eax, 7\n\nadds the value 7 to the value stored at the eax register.\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|        5           |\n----------------------       -------\n|        6           |       | eax |\n----------------------       -------\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp | 13  |\n----------------------       -------\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status and the value at eax register.\n\nSimilarly the next instruction:\nmov DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax\n\n\ncopies the value at eax into [rbp-8].\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|        13          |\n----------------------       -------\n|        6           |       | eax |\n----------------------       -------\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp | 13  |\n----------------------       -------\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status and the value at eax register.\n\nThe next instruction:\nmov eax, 0\n\nsets the value 0 at the eax register.\n|                    |\n----------------------\n|        13          |\n----------------------       -------\n|        6           |       | eax |\n----------------------       -------\n|       rbp          | &lt;-rsp |  0  |\n----------------------       -------\n|                    |\n\nFig: The current stack status and the value at eax register.\n\nThe next instruction :\npop rbp\n\npops the value from the stack and store it back into rbp.

But we will just work with small amount of dummy data.\nWe'll work by using a very well known algorithm that works on the basis of probability and it is \nThe Naive-Bayes Algorithm\nLet's say we have two sentences in our data.\n\nI love you my sweet heart.\nI love you my maiyya.\n\nNow what we'll do is just calculate the probability of occurence of each words after the given word.\nIf we have to guess the word(s) after the word 'I' we have to calculate the probability of occurence of every word that occurred after 'I' and the one above certain threshold is recommended.\nFor our above data, the probability of occurence of the word \"love\" after the word \"I\" is 100% because it appears every time after the word \"I\", so the word \"love\" will be recommended by our system. But we won't stop there because we want to guess the entire sentence, so we'll again then calculate the probability of occurence of every word after the word \"love\", in this case the word \"you\" has the highest probability (100%), we will continue this same process until we don't find the word having probability greater or equal to certain threshold value.\nIn this case, \"love you my\" will be recommended by the system if we typed in the word \"I\".\nThe Data Structure Setup\nRequirement\nWe need to keep track of words that appear after every word and their frequency as well.\nFor every new word we encounter in our data set, we assign a std::unordered_map&lt;std::string, int&gt; that holds the frequencies of the next word appearing after that word which is stored in a std::vector. The index of the std::vector is stored in another std::unordered_map&lt;std::string, int&gt; where the key is the word we encounter and value is the index.\nImplementation\nAssuming we have our data set in the file data.txt which is pre-processed as per our requirement.\nWe start by defining a struct \nstruct Recommendation{\n std::string word;\n float probability;\n};\n\nand then we also need some globals,\nstd::unordered_map&lt;std::string, long&gt; Index;\nstd::vector&lt;std::unordered_map&lt;std::string, long&gt;&gt; LookUp;\n\nNow we can start defining our function RecommendeWord. This function\ntakes a single argument, a word whose preceeding word(s) is to predicted.\nRecommendation RecommendWord(const std::string&amp; word){\n    auto Found = Index.find(word);\n    if(Found == Index.end()) return Recommendation{};\n    else{\n        auto LookUpIndex = Index[word];\n\t    int TotalOccurence{};\n        for(const auto&amp; [word, count]: LookUp[LookUpIndex]){\n          TotalOccurence += count;  \n        }\n     \tfor(const auto&amp; [word, count]: LookUp[LookUpIndex]){\n       \t  float Probability = (float)count / (float)TotalOccurence;\n\t      if(Probability &gt;= PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD){\n\t       return Recommendation{word, Probability}; \n\t      }\n\t    }\n        return Recommendation{};\n      }\n}\n\nWe start by checking if we have the input word in our data set, if not we exit early.\nIf the word is found, we will take its lookup index for the LookUp vector.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/word-recommendation-system-in-cpp/","title":"Writing a Word Recommendation system in C++"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/finite-automata/":{"body":553,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/stalking-the-cpp-compiler/":{"body":1000,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/word-recommendation-system-in-cpp/":{"body":280,"title":5}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
