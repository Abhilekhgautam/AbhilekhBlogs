Can we talk? There is something.... Let me start from the beginning.

Just like every other day, I was wandering around my college during the lunch break. I saw a ping pong ball coming near me. I bowed down to pick it up and got it in my hand. It was the exact time when I saw someone on a brown top with a farily long attractive hair. I don't remember clearly what happened next until one of the player asked me for the ball. I was totally blank. I gave the ball back to someone I don't quite remember whom.

Of Course, It was her. I couldn't see her face, in fact I didn't try. I was trying to figure out what happened. She was upstairs already, Computer First Semester I whispered.

It was nearly my class time. Bishal(a very good friend of mine) was with me. We went back to our class. After the class was over, I went out to the balcony from where I could exactly see her class. I waited to see her get out of the class. After a while she got out, it was about 3:50 in the afternoon when I saw her for the first time. She had a mask on her face. She was not alone, she had 2 other girls (probably her friend) with her. Bishal was also with me, I said look she is beautiful. Like everyone's friend would do, he smiled and said lets go and talk to her. I timidly yelled at him and we both went back to our class.

Afterwards I'd always ask Bishal to come with me to the balcony. We used to wait for her to arrive.
